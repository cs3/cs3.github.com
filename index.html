<h3>So, who am I?</h3>

<p>I’m Coimbatore Sankar Raman Shyam Sundar! This microblog is just a small window that lets out my thoughts. You will find code snippets, quotes, pics, stuff mostly enjoyed by geekdom!</p>

<h3>How I really am? </h3>

<p>This is a tricky question to answer! To start with, I’m always busy. It’s rare to find me sitting still and doing nothing. I have an active inquiring mind and particularly enjoy conversations that involve an exchange of information. I’m a little gregarious, reflective and shy. I can rarely resist showing someone else how a job should be done or a problem should be solved. As for moodiness, I can be full of sunshine one moment and fury the next but then who can’t? All that’s unusual is the speed at which I can change.</p>

<h3>What do I do otherwise?</h3>

<p>I converse, play, fight with the most amazing woman and a wonder kid. Driving and Classical Music are my other passions which keeps me filled.</p>
